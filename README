Read binary output files of STAGYY
General definitions are in a file main_process_stagyy_data.py that calls functions from stag.py
The aim is to have different cases in one file (Cartesian, Spherical Annulus, etc)

The code to read the binary output files has been adapted from a matlab version initially developed by Boris Kaus.
